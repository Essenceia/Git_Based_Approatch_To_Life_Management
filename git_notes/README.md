# Git cheatsheat 

This is a collection of small reminders on the diffrent git functionalities accompanied  
by some small notes. 

> P.S : If some of this seems obvious that is normal, I had to find 10 commandements so 
most of it is filling.

## The git commandements

- You shall not work directly on master. 
- You shall not use `-f` and it you do only by last resort. 
- You shall not apply some random fixe off stackoverflow.
- You shall update remote after every major change and not forget to pull. 
- You shall not write ambigious commit messages to skrew with other people. 
- You shall not include hastags or smileys in your commit messages.
- You shall start using `mergetool` more seriously.
- You shall never use a visual git aide without knowing exactly what it does. 
- You shall start using `git log` instead of going on github (or other) all the time 
to see your current status. ( `git log --oneline --graph --color --all --decorate` )
- You shall remember that git is an acyclic directed graph coded in C where tags and 
commit id's are acceses keys to the map and your trakers are pointers. Easy right ;P
