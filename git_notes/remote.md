# Working with remote

## Important notes

- Remote branches have the special property that when you check them out, you are put into detached HEAD mode. Git does this on purpose because you can't work on these branches 
directly; you have to work elsewhere and then share your work with the remote (after which your remote branches will be updated).
- pull = fetch + merge
