# Chip-first (mold-first) and Chip-last (RDL-first) FOWLP

## Chip-first

Chip-first is a process whereby the die is attached to a temporary or permanent 
material structure prior to making the RDL that will extend from the die to BGA 
interface. In this manner, the yield loss associated with creating the RDL occurs after 
the die is mounted, subjecting the die to potential loss.

## Chip-last 

In chip-last prosess, RDL is created first and then the die is mounted. In this flow, 
the RDL structures can either be electrically tested or visually inspected for yield 
loss, thereby avoiding placing good die on bad sites.

## Comparism 

For low I/O die, where RDL is minimal and yields are very high (>99%), a chip-first 
flow is preferred. However, for high value die (large I/O), a chip-last process is 
preferred.
