# Motivation for FO-WLP

### From a press release by SBWire 02/19/2019

> The innovation in the semiconductor packaging technology largely depends on the size 
of wafer. Hence, the increasing focus on wafer-level packages is resulting in chip 
industry to come up with advanced packaging solutions. The Fan-Out Wafer-Level 
Packaging (FO-WLP) technology is emerging as an alternative to the 2.5D packaging. 
Moreover, Fan-out wafer-level packaging can manage multiple dies as compared to the 
fan-in wafer-level packaging that can handle only single die. Fan-out packaging 
technology is also witnessing significant growth as it eliminates the need for process 
flows including wafer fluxing, bumping, cleaning, curing, flip-chip assembly, and 
underfill dispensing. 

- FO-WLP as an alternative to 2.5D packaging -> why ?
- Comparisum to Fan-In-WLP -> what are the main technological diffrenences, why 
multiple dies ?
- Eliminates the need for additional packaging step -> explain process in detail 

## Comparaison with FC and FI-WLP

Fan-out Wafer Level Packages like eWLB offer the following differentiated advantages:

    Over Flip-Chip Packaging:
        Slightly smaller footprint (clearance distances to the edges are smaller)
        Thinner package
        Substrate-less package (shorter interconnections meaning higher electrical 
performance and cheaper in the long run)
        Future potential for SiP and 3D integration
        Lower thermal resistance
        Simplified supply chain infrastructure
    Over Fan-In WLCSP:
        Higher board-level reliability
        Fan-out area to counter the pad limitation issue, adaptable to customer needs
        Only confirmed known good dice are packaged
        Potential for SiP integration
        Lower thermal resistance
        Built-in back-side protection
        No restriction in bump pitch
