# Motivation for FO-WLP

ASE senior fellow Bill Chen said ASE’s original motivation to license fan-out, and then later to work on its own implementation, was to increase the number of solder balls that 
could be placed under the increasingly tiny die. “The original fan-out motivation was to accommodate the die shrinks. Then, being creative engineers, we realized we can do a lot of 
other things with it, and create very thin packages,” he said.

> The innovation in the semiconductor packaging technology largely depends on the size 
of wafer. Hence, the increasing focus on wafer-level packages is resulting in chip 
industry to come up with advanced packaging solutions. The Fan-Out Wafer-Level 
Packaging (FO-WLP) technology is emerging as an alternative to the 2.5D packaging. 
Moreover, Fan-out wafer-level packaging can manage multiple dies as compared to the 
fan-in wafer-level packaging that can handle only single die. Fan-out packaging 
technology is also witnessing significant growth as it eliminates the need for process 
flows including wafer fluxing, bumping, cleaning, curing, flip-chip assembly, and 
underfill dispensing. 

- FO-WLP as an alternative to 2.5D packaging -> why ?
- Comparisum to Fan-In-WLP -> what are the main technological diffrenences, why 
multiple dies ?
- Eliminates the need for additional packaging step -> explain process in detail 

## Comparaison with FC and FI-WLP

Fan-out Wafer Level Packages like eWLB offer the following differentiated advantages:

    Over Flip-Chip Packaging:
        Slightly smaller footprint (clearance distances to the edges are smaller)
        Thinner package
        Substrate-less package (shorter interconnections meaning higher electrical 
performance and cheaper in the long run)
        Future potential for SiP and 3D integration
        Lower thermal resistance
        Simplified supply chain infrastructure
    Over Fan-In WLCSP:
        Higher board-level reliability
        Fan-out area to counter the pad limitation issue, adaptable to customer needs
        Only confirmed known good dice are packaged
        Potential for SiP integration
        Lower thermal resistance
        Built-in back-side protection
        No restriction in bump pitch

“There is a big difference in costs. Fan-out is lower cost than flip chip, which 
requires an organic substrate. And compared with silicon interposer, there is an even 
bigger cost difference, though maybe at this point there might be more performance with 
a silicon interposer,” she said.
