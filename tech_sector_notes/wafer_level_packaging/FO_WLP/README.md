# FO-WSP

## Definition 

Chen said the process involves dicing the chips on a silicon wafer, and then very 
precisely positioning them on a thin “reconstituted” or carrier wafer, which is 
then molded. The redistribution layer is created, and then solder balls are formed on 
top, just as in a wafer-level chip scale package. “The idea is very simple, to 
produce a reconstructed wafer and put it through the line,” he said, adding that 
“there are no laws of physics we are fighting, we are just fighting engineering, 
which means the challenges will be solved gradually. Fan-out is something that can be 
processed through wafer fab equipment—we need to pick the wafer up, place it, mold 
it, and bake it so the molding compound is cured. There is not any major wafer thinning 
needed like with TSVs. Clearly, fan-out technology is becoming more and more 
significant as we move further into the era of SIP and heterogeneous integration.”

## Applications

Rozalia Beica, CTO at Yole Developpement, said TSMC has been telling its suppliers to 
be ready for volume fan-out processing beginning next year, perhaps in the 
**100,000** wafers-per-month range.

## Challenges

### IR drop 

High fan-out of the net: Resulting in higher load-cap, or perhaps 
High routing congestion in a particular area resulting in high coupling capacitance 
with the neighboring nets.

## Looking further

How far fan-out packaging will go remains to be seen. But if multiple chips can be 
accommodated, it may cause some design teams to reconsider the need to create complex 
SoCs on advanced silicon, particularly for mobile and IoT systems. The analysts are 
predicting major shifts in how many chips will require more expensive types of 
packaging, such as flip chip, BGAs, interposers, and 3D integration.

This technology can be combined with PoP as in the A10.
