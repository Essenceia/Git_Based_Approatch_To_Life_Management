# Wafer-level and Panel-level FOWLP

The industry is working on fan-out based on a panel or square format for cost 
reduction. The panel format enables more die, thereby lowering costs. For example, a 
300mm wafer enables 616 packages at 10x10-mm2, while an 18x24inch2 panel produces 1911 
packages.
