# ARM Neoverse approach

The ARM's neovers s approach to dealing with the manefacturing issues raised by there 
128 cores designs. 
- CCIX
- SmartNIC

One such option leveraging [CCIX](ccix.md) links in order break down a single die into 
smaller 
**more manufacturable chiplets**. A large mesh of cores can then be split up smaller 
dies, 
improving yield and scalability.

Arm is also pushing the idea of scaling using SmartNIC integrations.
