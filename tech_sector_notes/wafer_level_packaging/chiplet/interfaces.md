# Chiplet interfaces

Before the notion of chiplets can become a reality, **standard interfaces** may be 
required. "High bandwidth memory (HBM) is an early example,â"says Park. â"It 
was somewhat easier because it was just a memory interface that targeted a specific 
application. A chiplet interface has to be more generic.â"

The DARPA CHIPS program is tackling that problem. They have selected Advanced Interface 
Bus (AIB) as a physical-layer interface, developed by Intel for die-to-die connection 
in their Embedded Multi-Die Interconnect Bridge (EMIB). Intel has made AIB available, 
royalty free, through the DARPA program. Other companies are developing lightweight 
protocols that run on top of this interface.( see CCIX ) 

But there may be the need for multiple specialized interfaces. â" HBM is a highly 
parallelized interface where you are moving massive amounts of data without resorting 
to high-speed IOs,â" explains Felton. â"It gives you throughput with nowhere near 
the power consumption and hence less thermal issue. There is PAM4, there are a lot of 
protocol interfaces out there. Depending upon the type of chip and its function, a 
chiplet will support one or more of the standard interfaces depending upon the required 
performance. "
