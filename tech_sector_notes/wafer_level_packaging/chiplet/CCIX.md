# Cache Coherent Interconnect for Accelerators (CCIX) 

Used for connection chips ( or chiplets ^^ ) inside a same/diffrent packages. It is a 
hight performance chip-to-chip interconnect architecture that provides a **cache 
coherency framework** for heterogeneous system architectures.

Cache Coherent Interconnect for Accelerators (CCIX), pronounced "see-six", is an **open 
cache coherent interconnect architecture** developed by the CCIX **Consortium**. CCIX 
is 
designed to simplify the communication between the central processor and the various 
accelerators in the system through a cache-coherent extension to standard PCIe.

## Coherency 

Cache coherency is automatically maintained at all time between the central processing 
unit and the various other accelerators in the system. Operating over standard PCIe, 
CCIX supports signaling rates between 16 GT/s and 25 GT/s per link with support for 
port aggregation for higher performance.
