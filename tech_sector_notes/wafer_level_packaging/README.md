# Advances in wafer level packaging

Theys are small notes on new/upcomming wafer level packaging technologies. These notes 
were taken in feburary of 2018 in preperation for a presentation on the subject at 
CentraleSupelec Rennes, SERI.

Due to the end of monolithic scaling the industry is looking towards new packaging 
phylosphies for futur gains. 

## Why can't current scalling continue as is 

- end of moores law for scalling 
- rising cost of new nodes 
- falling yields on new nodes
- complexity 

## Technologies of intrest

- FO-WLP Fan-Out Wafer-Level Packaging
- POP 
- heterogenious 3D SiP
