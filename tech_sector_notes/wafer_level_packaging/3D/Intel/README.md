# Intel's 3D SiP technology 

This technology enables next-generation platforms by offering : 
- higher bandwidth
- lower power
- a smaller form factor
-  increased functionality and flexibility

## Challenges Intel has identified for the futur

Inovation in this field is motivated according to Intel because current packaging technologies have hit there limit regarding : 
- Chip-to-chip bandwidth limited by the interconnect density permitted by underlying PCB. 
- System power is too high due to the need to drive long PCB traces between components.
- Form factor is too big due to the number of discrete components required for the desired system functionality

# Embedded Multi-die Interconnect Bridge (EMIB)

## Flexibility 

Heterogeneous 3D SiP technology decouples the transceiver 
tile or die from the core fabric die: the transceiver is separate 
and sits next to the core fabric die. Therefore, the transceiver 
and core fabric die do not have to be manufactured on 
the same process node. 

The heterogeneous 3D SiP technology allows Intel to mix 
components to match system requirements, effectively 
providing robust solutions more quickly than in previous 
generations.
