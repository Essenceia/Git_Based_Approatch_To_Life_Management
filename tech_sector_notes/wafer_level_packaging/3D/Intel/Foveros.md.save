# Foveros ( Greek for fearful, awesome and terrifying)

More diverse applications -> System requirement diversity -> Power, performance, area, 
ect... optimization needed for better overall performance of chip -> Transisitor 
diversity -> IC diversity -> let s put them on seperate chips 

Intel s solution to the problem of developing independent chiplets on their own 
optimal processes and then interconnecting them in a single package to match the 
functionality of a monolithic SoC.

## Challenge

A major packaging challenge historically has been the bumps/pillar and interconnect 
among many other. **Data movement** across dies can take up a **large portion of the 
total 
package available power**. In fact, the **fine pitch interconnects** from 
die-to-package 
are 
largely **limited by mass reflow** which has prevented them from scaling much in recent 
nodes. A great property of solder bumps is that there is so much substance there that 
when it flows, it s able to accommodate all the non-uniformities of the die and the 
package.

This is where the true benefits of Si interposers (2.5D) and die stacking (3D) are 
realized. Compared to a standard package with a bump pitch of around **110-micron** and 
yields around **1.7 pJ/bit**, Intelâs side-by-side EMIB (2.5D) solution is around 
**45-micron pitch** and at around one-sixth the power per bit transferred at **0.30 
pJ/bit**. 

## Ancestor : Polaris

3D pacakging experimental technology part of the Tera-Scale Computer Research Program, 
early 2000s.

Polaris stacked a large SRAM die on top of the processor chip in order to achieve a 
very high memory bandwidth.
